<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>Welcome to Yoga Sleep! Yoga Sleep is a guided meditation app incorporating techniques from yoga nidra and modern therapies allowing the listener to fall asleep or pursue personal development in areas such as self awareness, focus, confidence and others. The notes below offer a quick guide on how to use some of the features, all you then need to do is find a comfortable, quiet place, relax and enjoy!</p>

<p>This is the free version of Yoga Sleep, we hope you enjoy it. For a much larger selection of Recordings and many more individual components to create your own recordings from, please try out our paid version.</p>

<b>RECORDINGS</b>
<p>The Recordings page has a list of complete recordings to listen to. The recordings are categorized as either sleep or alert. Sleep recordings focus on deep relaxation and techniques which are optimal for guiding the listener into a deep sleep. Alert recordings include yoga nidra and other techniques which are designed to take users into a state of deep relaxation and focus where dramatic spiritual and personal development work is done. Alert recordings guide the listener back to a waking state at the end of the recording. The listener can see the component parts which comprise each recording so they can see which components they particularly like and then select them when they create their own recordings.</p>

<b>CREATING</b>
<p>The Create page gives you the ability to create your own recording. All the components that comprise the recordings are listed plus many others. Selecting a component shows you information on it including suggestions on how to use it, selecting the green plus icon adds it to the playlist. To see the playlist you have selected, press the view icon. You can rearrage, clear, play or save the playlist to the recording screen by pressing any of the icons.</p>

<b>GENERAL TIPS</b>
<p>The component files in the create section are categorized under 5 main headings: Intros and Endings, Sensations, Breathing,  Imagery, Cognitive and a Miscellaneous heading. The component files each have a category- General, Sleep or Alert. A simple way to create a recording is to choose an intro and an ending from the Intros and Endings category then a component from each of the main categories. It is recommended to have a Sensations or Breathing recording after the intro as this focuses the mind which makes imagery techniques and Cognitive techniques more effective. The order of techniques after this is a matter of personal preference.</p>

<b>SLEEP TIPS</b>
<p>Generally, techniques which are quicker or more involved should not be left towards the end of a sleep recording. Techniques such as Rotation of Consciousness and Imagery techniques are useful in engaging the mind completely so it does not stray, but breathing techniques and Sensation techniques such as Tension control are often easier to drift into sleep with (In addition to Ending to Sleep and Deep Sleep components).</p>

<b>YOGA NIDRA</b>
<p>Yoga Nidra is generally done by bringing the awareness through more subtle parts of the self until you come to conscious deep sleep. Start with an introduction, then Intention, Rotation of Consciousness 2-3 times if possible, ending with the slower version, then a passive breathing technique (no changing of the breathing), then 1-2 Pairs recordings (In Miscellaneous, more than 1-2 if you wish), a Quick images technique and another imagery technique if desired, followed by intention again and finally ending to wake. This format brings awareness through the physical body, the breath, the emotions and finally the images affect the unconscious mind. It is not necessary to have a waking recording at the end, this state can then lead into a deep meditation, or a sleep recording can be used to drift off into sleep.</p>

<p>These are brief notes to get you started. Go to the More Info section which has the contact and website details where there is more information and suggestions on how to make recordings.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p class="p1"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p class="p2">Welcome to Yoga Sleep! Yoga Sleep is a guided sleep app incorporating techniques from the Indian Tantric practise of Yoga Nidra and modern therapies allowing the listener to fall deeply asleep at night or enjoy very deep relaxation any other time and develop greater self awareness. The notes below offer a quick guide on how to use some of the features, all you then need to do is find a comfortable, quiet place, lie down, relax and enjoy!</p>
<p class="p1"><b>SLEEP HYGIENE</b></p>
<p class="p2">Yoga Sleep helps listeners to sleep by focusing, calming and relaxing overactive and busy/worried minds. Organic causes of poor sleep can often be addressed by simple changes in behaviour. In addition to widely known causes of sleep problems such as drinking caffeine too late, sleeping in the day and having an irregular sleep cycle, staring at computer screens late at night can cause dramatic sleep problems for some people. Computer screen light can cause the brain to delay production of the sleep assisting hormone Melatonin. A good tip is not to look at a screen within at least 2 hours of going to bed, wherever possible.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>RECORDINGS</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Recordings page has a list of complete recordings to listen to. The recordings are categorized as either sleep or alert. Sleep recordings focus on techniques which are optimal for guiding the listener into a deep sleep. Alert recordings include yoga nidra and other techniques which are designed to take users into a state of deep relaxation and focus leading to profound feelings of energy, rejuvenation and calmness of mind. Alert recordings guide the listener back to a waking state at the end of the recording. The listener can see the component parts which comprise each recording so they can see which components they particularly like and then select them when they create their own recordings.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>CREATING</b></p>
<p class="p2">The Create page gives you the ability to create your own recording and this ability to personalize them is what<span class="Apple-converted-space">Â  </span>makesYoga Sleep so different to any other guided sleep or meditation CDs or applications. All the components that comprise the recordings are listed plus many others in the paid version. Selecting a component shows you information on it including suggestions on how to use it, selecting the green plus icon adds it to the playlist. To see the playlist you have selected, press the view icon. You can rearrange, clear or play the playlist by pressing any of the icons. Playing it automatically saves it.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>GENERAL TIPS</b></p>
<p class="p2">The component files in the create section are categorized under 5 main headings: Intros and Endings, Physical Sensations, Breathing, Imagery, Internal Dialogue and a Miscellaneous heading. The component files each have a category- General, Sleep or Alert. A simple way to create a recording is to choose an intro and an ending from the Intros and Endings category then a component from each of the 5 main categories. It is recommended to have a Sensations or Breathing recording after the intro as this focuses the mind which makes imagery techniques and Cognitive techniques more effective. The order of techniques after this is a matter of personal preference.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>SLEEP TIPS</b></p>
<p class="p2">Generally, techniques which are quicker or more involved should not be left towards the end of a sleep recording. Techniques such as Rotation of Consciousness and Imagery techniques are useful in engaging the mind completely so it does not stray, but breathing techniques and Sensation techniques such as Tension control are often easier to drift into sleep with (In addition to Ending to Sleep and Deep Sleep components).</p>
<p class="p1"><b>ALERT TIPS</b></p>
<p class="p2">The most important factors in an alert practise are getting into as deeply focused a state as possible and relaxing as deeply as possible without falling asleep. When you reach a state like this, the effects from the internal dialogue practises such as Ego Strengthening and Deep Sleep Daytime are dramatically enhanced. Rotation of consciousness and quick images are particularly good at focusing the mind as the speed does not allow time for the mind to drift off.</p>
<p class="p2">If you are regularly doing both sleep and alert/yoga nidra practises, it is our experience that it is better to use Rotation of Consciousness in just one type of practise. If used in a sleep practise to quiet the mind, it is possible for it to be associated with a sleepy state and not one of alert awareness when doing alert practises. If this becomes an issue, the best use of it is in an alert practise as Tension Control and Progressive Relaxation are equally good for beginning sleep practises.</p>
<p class="p1"><b>YOGA NIDRA TIPS</b></p>
<p class="p2">Traditional Yoga Nidra is practised by bringing the awareness through more subtle parts of the self (Body, breath, emotions, mind etc) until you come to conscious deep sleep (where you are alert and aware). Start with an introduction, Rotation of Consciousness 2-3 times if possible, ending with the slower version, then a passive breathing technique (no changing of the breathing), then 1-2 Pairs recordings (In Miscellaneous, more than 1-2 if you wish), a Quick images technique and another imagery technique or as many as desired, and finally ending to wake. It can be nice to include one or several 1 Minute Silence recordings (Miscellaneous category) which allow a practitioner to create a recording with time to simply sit in that wonderfully deep, experience of awareness at the end of a session before the ending to wake component. This format brings awareness through the physical body, the breath, the emotions and finally the images affect the unconscious mind. It is not necessary to have a waking recording at the end, this state can then lead into a deep meditation, or a sleep recording can be used to drift off into sleep.</p>

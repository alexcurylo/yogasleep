<p>Practises such as yoga, yoga nidra/tantra and meditation have developed over thousands of years primarily for high level spiritual purposes, such as seeking enlightenment, understanding God etc. Today these are still valid aspirations but the fast pace of busy, modern society and the demands it places on its members has created many barriers to leading a truly happy, content, spiritual life. Issues such as anxiety, insomnia, stress, apathy/lack of motivation are prevalent and are the cause of a great deal of unhappiness. Spiritual practises can be of great help in alleviating some of these problems, particularly as a method of relaxation, but these benefits are the side effects of practises not designed primarily to address such issues. Modern therapeutic techniques such as hypnotherapy and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) have developed specifically to address many of the problems encountered today and evidence based research methods have made them very effective and efficient, with anxiety based disorders being commonly treated effectively in mere weeks. Many of their methods evolved from tantra and yoga techniques but there is still a social stigma attached to seeking therapy and it is often only when the problem becomes chronic that that option is sought out. Therapy also lacks the social interaction that group yoga or meditation classes offer.</p>

<p>Yoga Sleep is an example of the meditative side of a modern yoga that is empowering and purposeful and effective in behaviour changing, produces powerful spiritual changes and is socially acceptable.</p>

<p>This same approach works with yoga asanas. Visit <a href="http://www.digitalspirituallife.com/">the website</a> for more info on classes and keep a look out for our future video app!</p>
